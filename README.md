# What is this?

This is the repo for the rocket control unit.

Most of the development is done in [python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/),
and access to the RCU can be done through ssh.

Contact a lead for information regarding ssh access.

## Dependencies

### Linux Only

The biggest dependencies will require you to use the `RPi.GPIO` python library.
This can only be done on Linux, LOL.
```bash
# pip install RPi.GPIO
```

### Windows Users

Windows users should enable [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
and clone the repo and instal `RPi.GPIO` through pip as above and
make changes from there.

## Getting Started

See the following [examples directory](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Examples/)
for use on how to get started.

## Style Guide

All code should adhere to the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
code standard.
There are [autoformatters](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) available which can do this for you.

### Type Hinting

Code should use typehints when available to allow for better readability.
